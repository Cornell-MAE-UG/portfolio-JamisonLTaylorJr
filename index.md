## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with a strong focus on hands-on design, prototyping, and interdisciplinary problem-solving. My work centers on turning ideas into functional, well-thought-out systems through iterative design, testing, and refinement. I am especially drawn to projects that sit at the intersection of mechanical design, robotics, and user-focused engineering, where technical performance and real-world impact matter equally.

I currently work in Professor Robert Shepherd’s Organic Robotics Laboratory, where I contribute to a volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) 3D printer project by designing mechanical test beds and improving material measurement methods. In parallel, I serve as an undergraduate manufacturing trainee at Cornell’s Autodesk Design & Make Space, where I train students on the safe and effective use of manufacturing equipment and support hands-on prototyping and fabrication. Alongside my technical work, I am deeply involved with NSBE, serving as the Upstate Zone Vice Chair for Region 1. In this role, I support chapter coordination and help plan and execute zone-wide initiatives, including the Fall Zone Conference and the upcoming Spring Zone Conference. Together, these experiences have strengthened my technical skill set, leadership abilities, and commitment to clear communication, collaboration, and impactful engineering work.
